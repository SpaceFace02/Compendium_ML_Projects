## Compedium of all my working Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Projects done uptil now, starting from June 2020.

### To run the project, you need to install the following:

1. Anaconda Distribution, with Jupyter Lab/Notebook along with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Sci-Kit Learn, PIL, NLTK, Spacy, Plotly, Cufflinks etc.
2. Make virtual environments for each of the projects, and install the pacakges mentioned in te import statements.

### Alternatively, you can install a virtual environment using a requirements.txt file in the project folder by using the following commands. First, cd into the base directory, with all the projects and run the following commands:

- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python file.py or select the virtual env from jupyter notebook/lab.`
- `If using an IDE or code editor, be sure to change the python interpretor path to the python executable in the venv folder.`

P.S If the source command doesn't work, then do the following in place of that:

- `cd venv\Scrips\activate.bat`

### The Projects' Descriptions

- **Blue Pen Tracking** - Tracks a pen with a blue cap across the videocam, bu drawing streaks of color.
- **Book Reviews** - Using a dataset from Kaggle, find the genre of book based on various features.
- **Cartoonify Yourself** - Cartoonify your own image using a pretrained model.
- **Detecting Fake News** - Detecting fake news using a Passive Aggressive Algorithms. (References present in the notebook).
- **Drowsiness Detector** - Detects if the user is drowsy or not in a car while driving.
- **Ensemble, Forests, Trees** - Exploring various tree models and their performance.
- **Eye Dropper Color Picker Tool** - Detects any color in any image, works just like a color dropper in Photoshop.
- **Human Detection** - Detects human in a video using HOG Descriptor. (References present in the notebook).
- **Lane Detection** - Detects the lanes in a video. Uses Hough Lines. (Reference video present in the notebook).
- **License Detector** - Detects the license plate in an image.
- **Multiple Color Detection** - Detects the colors in a live stream video.
- **Netflix Movie Reviews** - Exploratory Data Analysis on the Movie Reviews dataset on Kaggle. Also building a content and collaborative filtering recommender system.
- **Parkinson Disease Detection** - Detects if a person is suffering from Parkinson's disease using a datset from Kaggle
- **Quora Question Pairs** - Removing the duplicate questions from the Quora dataset from Kaggle. Done for the IECSE chatbot project.
- **Time Series Analysis (RNN's, LSTM's)** - Predicting and drawing the sine wave from previous data and predicting sales forecase for a clothing company (RSCCASN).
- **Smile Selfie Taker** - Takes a picture only when the user is smiling.
- **Student Marks** - Doing Explorative Data Analysis on the Student Marks dataset from Kaggle.
- **Support Vector Machines** - Exploring SVM's in more detail.
- **Titanic** - Exploring the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Also using Plotly and Cufflinks to plot interactive graphs.
- **Uber Project** - Doing some EDA on the Uber dataset from Kaggle. Detecting location of the users calling cabs, frequencies of cabs and other interesting aspects.
- **Wine Quality Prediction** - Exploring the Wine Quality datasset from Kaggle and classifying wine in 5 classes, based on their quality, from various features, like density, citric acid content, chlorides etc.
- **Word Clouds** - Generates a word cloud from a text file. In this case, the text comes from the youtube comments of the music videos of Eminem.
